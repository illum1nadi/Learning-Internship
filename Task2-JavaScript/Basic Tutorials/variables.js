const number = 3;
//Can use double quotes or single quotes for strings.
const string = "Hello, World!";
const boolean = false;
const array = [1, 2, 3];
const object = {   
    name: "Aditya",
    age: 20,

//This is to access the properties of the object.
console.log(object.name); // Aditya

//Var helps us declare a variable that can be changed later, and the scope is global.
var x = 5; 

//Let helps us declare a variable that can be changed later, and the scope is block.
let y = 10;

//Const helps us declare a variable that cannot be changed later, and the scope is block.
const z = 15;


//Exercise
var myNumber = 4;
var myString = "Variables, are great";
var myBoolean = false;
